# CENO Portal

The CENO Portal gives users of the CENO Client a way to start exploring content that has been
inserted into the distributed storage system in use as soon as they get started.

## Structure

```

All of the code relevant to serving the Portal from the CENO Client is located in `ceno-client/src/portal.go`.

## Prerequisites

Building the CENO Client requires [Golang 1.5.1](https://golang.org/dl/) (and hopefully later versions will work
seamlessly).

In order to use the automatic build tools described below to handle Portal resources, [Node.js and
NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) will need to be installed, along with the [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build tool.
In Debian-based systems you should also install the `nodejs-legacy` package.

Once Node and NPM are installed, gulp can be installed by running

```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

This is only needed if you intend to run gulp tasks manually.

## Building

All of the content in the portal page is encapsulated in this directory, however in order
to make the content available to the CENO Client (so that it knows where to find relevant
files so its HTTP server can read and serve them), there is a bit of work that needs to be done.

1. Javascript files need to be converted from ES6 to browser-friendly ES5 as well as linted.
2. CSS files need to be concatenated together so that one main file can simply be applied to all pages.
3. HTML files need to be copied from the `portal/html` directory to the CENO Client's `views` directory.
4. Translation files need to be concatenated and moved out to the main `ceno-client` directory.

All of this work is handled automatically by the [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build tool.

There are four primary tasks that one can invoke to handle each kind of resource.

1. `gulp translations` - Combine and move the translation files
2. `gulp js` - Lint, transpile, and move the Javascript files
3. `gulp css` - Concatenate the CSS files
4. `gulp html` - Move the HTML files

Each of the above tasks exist for developer conveniece.  One is perfectly able to run the CENO Client,
change one of the above resources, run the relevant gulp task(s), and then refresh the portal page to
observe the changes.  This eliminates the necessity of recompiling the entire client codebase every time a change is
made.

There is also a task `gulp build` that runs all four of the above tasks.

Finally, the `ceno-client/build.sh` script will run all of the above tasks as well as format and compile Go code and
install all dependencies (including the ones required for the above tasks).

## Navigating

The CENO Portal page, by default, is available on `http://localhost:3090/portal`.
